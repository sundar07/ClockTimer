# ClockTimer

This repository contains image analysis codes for segmenting single cells from brightfield images. This code has been used in the article "Cell-autonomous timing drives the vertebrate segmentation clockâ€™s wave pattern" by [Rohde L.A. et al., 2024] DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93764.2


1. Segment_cells_bright_field.m
This code segments single cells from brightfield images. The code is set for detecting cells that are approx. at the centre of the image, but can be adapted to segment cells anywhere in the image
